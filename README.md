# Tricky Sticky Header Challenge (est. <2h)

The challenge is making the "Disappearing Header" re-appear if the scroll direction is upwards.
See the [Represent Shop](https://representclo.com/collections/t-shirts) for reference.

Spec:

- When the header re-appears, it shall push down the content (Product) sticky header.
- When the scrolling direction is downwards, it shall disappear.
- There shall be no visisble gaps between the disappearing header & the sticky header-
- Virtualize the product list with [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized)
